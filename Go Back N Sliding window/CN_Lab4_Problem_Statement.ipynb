    "* Consider two machines a sender and a reciever. Implement Go-back-n sliding window Algorithms between these two machines using socket.\n",
    "* Your program should meet the following guidelines:\n",
    "    * Read input data from a file.\n",
    "    * construct the data frame as follows\n",
    "    * | | seauence number | | payload | | checksum | |\n",
    "    * Use internet checksum algorithm to compute and verify checksum\n",
    "    * Although error rate is low but few frames do arrive with error.\n",
    "    * Define SWS and RWS.\n",
    "    * Define RTT.\n",
    "    * Define transmit / Retransmit frame(s) and acknowledgement(s) as defined by Go-back-n algorithm.\n",
    "    * To implement 'timeout' use either system clock or apply logic to simulate it."
